  title: DigiMed Bayern
  description: DigiMed Bayern's goal is to guide Bavaria with a lighthouse project into the medicine of the future. It combines comprehensive datasets of patients diagnosed with atherosclerotic diseases and integrates multi-dimensional -omic data. The aim is to reach P4 medicine (predictive, preventive, personalized, participatory) as it is one of the world's most promising developments for improved, holistic and efficient healthcare.  I am developing an ethically and legally compliant, highly secure and sustainable biomedical workbench that is the corner stone of the project (<a href="https://digimed-bayern.de" target="_blank">link</a>).
